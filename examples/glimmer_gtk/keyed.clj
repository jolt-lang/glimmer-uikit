  "Non-interactive proof that glimmer's keyed reconciliation reuses widgets across
  add/remove/reorder instead of recreating them by position. Mounts a vbox of
  labels keyed by a stable :id, then mutates the backing list — reverse, remove a
  middle item, insert at the front — and after each mutation checks two things
  against the live GTK tree:

    1. surviving keys keep the SAME widget pointer (reuse, not recreate), so a
       row's signal handlers and local state would follow its key; and
    2. GTK's actual child order (walked via get_first_child/get_next_sibling)
       matches the requested item order.

  Reconciliation is synchronous (a ratom write notifies watchers inline), so each
  mutation is fully reconciled by the time we assert. Run via the :keyed task;
  needs a display. Exits non-zero on any failed check."
