(ns glimmer-gtk.repl-live-smoke
  "Regression smoke for live GUI development over nREPL.

  A label is bound to a ratom. A WORKER thread (standing in for an nREPL eval on
  its worker thread) mutates the ratom while the app is running. The reactive
  re-render must hop onto the GTK main loop via a one-shot g_idle_add source
  (gui-loop-running? marshalling in glimmer.core), NOT reconcile inline on the
  worker thread — on macOS that off-main-thread GTK mutation aborts under AppKit.

  Marshalling is confirmed two ways:
    1. no crash (exit 0) — without marshalling, the worker-thread re-render
       touches GTK off the main thread and AppKit aborts; and
    2. after the loop quits, the worker's mutation is reflected in a render
       (the deferred main-loop re-render applied it).

  Auto-quits and exits 0 printing SMOKE OK; non-zero on failure."
