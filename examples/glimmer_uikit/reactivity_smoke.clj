  "Non-interactive proof that glimmer's reactivity works against the live AppKit
  loop. Mounts a Form-1 component whose render increments a counter; a scheduled
  job then swaps the reactive cell the component reads. The component must
  re-render exactly once (render-count goes 1 -> 2). Run via the :smoke task;
  requires a GUI session. Exits non-zero on failure."
