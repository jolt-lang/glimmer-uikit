  "Non-interactive proof that glimmer's keyed reconciliation reuses widgets across
  add/remove/reorder instead of recreating them by position. Mounts a vbox of
  labels keyed by a stable :id, then mutates the backing list — reverse, remove a
  middle item, insert at the front — and after each mutation checks two things
  against the live AppKit tree:

    1. surviving keys keep the SAME widget pointer (reuse, not recreate), so a
       row's signal handlers and local state would follow its key; and
    2. the stack's actual arranged-subview order matches the requested order.

  Reconciliation is synchronous (a ratom write notifies watchers inline), so each
  mutation is fully reconciled by the time we assert. The whole check runs as one
  scheduled loop job, then quits. Run via the :keyed task; needs a GUI session.
  Exits non-zero on any failed check."
