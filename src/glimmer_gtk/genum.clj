  "Resolve GTK/GObject GEnum members to their integer value at RUNTIME, from the
  GObject type registry — so glimmer carries NO enum-constant tables.

  Every GEnum type registers its members with an idiomatic lowercase *nick*
  (GtkAlign has :fill :start :center :end ...). That nick IS a Clojure keyword.
  We look it up via g_enum_get_value_by_nick and read the integer out of the
  returned GEnumValue struct, then hand the int to the C setter. So a prop like
  [:label {:halign :start}] needs no GTK_ALIGN_START constant anywhere.

  One wrinkle — lazy registration. A type only enters the registry once its
  _get_type() runs. For widget *property* enums that happens during the owning
  widget class's init: GtkWidget's init installs halign/valign -> registers
  GtkAlign; a label's init registers GtkJustification; a box's registers
  GtkOrientation. glimmer applies these props in the :apply step, by which point
  the widget already exists and its enum is live, so resolution is reliable
  there. The lone at-construction case (box orientation) is built with a default
  and corrected in :apply, where the freshly-created box has made the type live.

  Only GEnum/GFlags types resolve this way; plain #define numeric macros aren't
  in the registry and must be declared explicitly where truly needed (glimmer
  has none for layout)."
