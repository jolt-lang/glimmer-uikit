  "Hiccup -> GTK4 widgets. A data-driven registry maps hiccup tags to widget
  constructors, prop maps to GTK setter calls, and :on-* event keys to GTK
  signals wired through foreign-callable. This layer creates/patches widgets and
  manages container children; glimmer's reconciler decides when, reaching these
  functions through the backend map in glimmer-gtk.core.

  Lifecycle: create! builds a widget (constructs it, applies props, connects any
  :on-* handlers). apply-props! re-applies the prop map to an existing widget on
  re-render. Signals are connected once at mount — handlers are expected to close
  over reactive cells (not values), so the first render's closure stays correct
  for the widget's life, exactly like reagent."

;; but it is HTML-flavoured — it will happily emit <div>, <br>, or a typo'd span
;; attribute, which gtk_label_set_markup then can't parse (the label falls back
;; to raw text or emits a GTK warning). So we validate the hiccup *data* against
;; Pango's vocabulary before handing it to hiccup for serialization: a bad
;; fragment fails loudly at the call site instead of rendering silently wrong.
;;
;; Attribute names mirror Pango's own (underscores: :font_family, :letter_spacing),
;; so what you write is exactly what Pango parses.
