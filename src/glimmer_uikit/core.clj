(ns glimmer-uikit.core
  "The AppKit backend for glimmer (the macOS native toolkit — 'uikit' names this
  project, not the iOS framework). Requiring this namespace installs it, after
  which glimmer's portable reconciler (glimmer.core) renders hiccup into real
  AppKit views:

    (ns myapp
      (:require [glimmer.ratom :refer [atom]]
                [glimmer.core :as ui]
                [glimmer-uikit.core]))          ; installs the AppKit backend

    (defn -main [& _] (ui/run my-app :title \"hello\"))

  What this namespace supplies to glimmer.backend is the toolkit half of the
  seam: element creation and prop application (glimmer-uikit.widget), container
  child management, the app loop, and the marshalling of off-thread work onto
  that loop.

  The app loop is NSApplication; run! builds a window, mounts the root
  component into it, and calls [NSApp run], which blocks running the AppKit
  main loop. Every event handler is a :collect-safe foreign-callable invoked
  from inside that loop. Off-thread re-renders land via a CFRunLoopSource
  registered on the main run loop — the AppKit analogue of GTK's g_idle_add,
  without needing libdispatch or blocks (a source's perform callback is a plain
  C function pointer)."
  (:require [glimmer.backend :as b]
            [glimmer-uikit.ffi :as u]
            [glimmer-uikit.widget :as w]
            [jolt.ffi :as ffi]))

;; --- marshalling work onto the AppKit main loop ------------------------------
;; While [NSApp run] blocks the main thread, a ratom mutation made off that
;; thread (an nREPL eval on its worker thread, or any future) would otherwise
;; reconcile — calling AppKit — off the main thread, which AppKit rejects.
;; glimmer.core defers those re-renders through backend/schedule, which lands
;; here. A single CFRunLoopSource on the main run loop drains a queue of thunks;
;; posting is signal+wakeup, so no per-post allocation happens.
